          - new feature: warnings { code } and warning { code }, for capturing
            the contents of warnings for subsequent testing

          - when allowing warnings (via allow_warnings()), messages are
            emitted via note() rather than warn(), for less noisy output when
            running in a harness

          - Test suite (and code) fixed to work in the presence of
            Test::Builder 1.005+ (TB2)
          - END logic fixed: now a no-warnings test is added whenever any
            tests have been run, even if there is no plan, as was originally
            intended
