0.010     2013-09-25 03:29:53Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - re-release with fixed compile test

0.009     2013-09-11 04:49:55Z (Karen Etheridge)
          - fixed error in synopsis (we do not export anything by default)
          - a caveat added to the documentation regarding embedding warning
            checks inside another sub (this is for you, ribasushi!!!)
          - ':no_end_test' now also covers side effects of done_testing, as
            well as END blocks, making it possible to use the warning(s) subs
            without having an end warning test while using done_testing
            (necessary when combining with the 'if' pragma)

0.008     2013-07-14 12:02:01 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - compile test updated, to hopefully fix mswin32 parsing issues

0.007     2013-07-09 15:10:36 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - fix subtest tests to work on Test::More before 0.95_01
            (RT#86802)

0.006     2013-06-20 17:53:54 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - remove use of Class::Method::Modifiers

0.005     2013-06-20 12:18:42 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - new feature: warnings { code } and warning { code }, for capturing
            the contents of warnings for subsequent testing

0.004     2013-05-21 14:58:55 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - when allowing warnings (via allow_warnings()), messages are
            emitted via note() rather than warn(), for less noisy output when
            running in a harness

0.003     2013-04-13 14:07:58 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          - Test suite (and code) fixed to work in the presence of
            Test::Builder 1.005+ (TB2)
          - END logic fixed: now a no-warnings test is added whenever any
            tests have been run, even if there is no plan, as was originally
            intended

0.002     2013-03-14 14:47:30 PDT-0700 (Karen Etheridge)
          Releasing as non-TRIAL for greater visibility.
          - ':no_end_test' option added
          - test added showing that we play nicely with 'skip_all'

0.001-TRIAL  2013-03-09 16:56:29 PST-0800 (Karen Etheridge)
          - Initial release.
